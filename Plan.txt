GUI Python done for the most part
Deck changed to just strings to send between client and server
Got rid of most comments so we need to write our own

***********************************
to do:
Fixing ace check for 1 or 11
(button for 1 or 11)

for server,
keep track of player connections to server
once all players are connected, start game
once all player turns are done, get values and send winner to the client.

Spellcheck everything that isn't written by us

*bonus*
keep track of player scores in real time.
When established connection, client writes their name

more debugging

Images per card

Dark mode
