GUI Python done for the most part
Deck changed to just strings to send between client and server
Got rid of most comments so we need to write our own

***********************************
to do:
for server,
keep track of player connections to server
once all players are connected, start game
once all player turns are done, get values and send winner to the client.

*bonus*
keep track of player scores in real time.
When established connection, client writes their name

more debugging
