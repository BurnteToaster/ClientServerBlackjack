GUI Python done for the most part
Deck changed to just strings to send between client and server
Got rid of most comments so we need to write our own

*important to basically finishd code*
first things first we need to play the game on the server to send a win or loss
to client.

for server,
keep track of player connections to server
once all players are connected, start game
make method for game where you make deck, shuffle, deal, etc
once all player turns are done, get values and send winner to the client.

Spellcheck everything that isn't written by us

Fixing ace check for 1 or 11
(button for 1 or 11)

*bonus*
keep track of player scores in real time.
When established connection, client writes their name

more debugging
